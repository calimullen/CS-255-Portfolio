# CS-255-Portfolio
In this project, the client DriverPass wanted to create a system to aid in the process of students learning to drive and getting their driver’s license. The Driverpass system allows students to access practice exams, schedule driving practice, and get in-person driving practice before the exam. The client wanted Driverpass to be an easy-to-use system to create appointments, take practice exams, and store all the student’s information in one place. I think I did well in completing my UML diagrams for each aspect of the Driverpass system. I also think I did well in explaining these processes in a non-technical way for clients that do not have a technical background. If I could revise one aspect, I would go into more detail for each section to get a better overall understanding of the system being produced. When designing software, I like to break everything down into smaller sections. This can keep the team from getting overwhelmed or unorganized. Personally, when working on a project, breaking things down into sections based on size, or difficulty can make the project move faster and eliminate time waste or repetition in designing.
